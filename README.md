# quiz-javaScript

I was tasked with building a quiz using html, css, and javascript. This was a very, very, challenging assignment, as I continue to learn more every day I will likely revisit this code and update some of the features. On my first try I wanted to use a constructor function to build my questions but due to time constraints I went with a more basic approach. I'm pleased with the look and feel of the results but there is a lot more I can do to improve my code in the future when time permits.
